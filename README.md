A repository for CS534 homework 1. Maybe it would be cleaner to make a single repository for the whole class. This would mean changing the URL for the repo for all of our remotes so keep that in mind.


To download data:
```
curl http://classes.engr.oregonstate.edu/eecs/fall2017/cs534/hw1/hw1-data.tgz 
tar -xzvf hwq-data.tgz
```

.gitignore includes dir name, if you change it be careful not to accidentally track the training/test data.
